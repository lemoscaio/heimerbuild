## Motivation
I love how complex League of Legends is, and how every patch the meta can change by simply modifying the AD ratio for a certain character.

Because of this, I always wondered how I could calculate every aspect of a battle, starting from calculating all stats given by items, runes, and level, to how much damage I could do in a combo mixing all of the champion's skills depending on which champion I'm playing against. 

We all know that the current training mode is not good enough. It takes time to start a new training session since it's a real match after all. Not only that but there's no way of changing the runes quickly without creating a new match.

So my goal is to improve this project until I'll be able everything that happens in a battle that I already said and some others. This includes calculating how much time I'll take in a combo after all we know an AD Carrier does not always have the opportunity to just auto-attack the enemy to death depending on the matchup.
